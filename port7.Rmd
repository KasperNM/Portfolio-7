This assignment contains two major parts:
A. Analyses of the behavioral data from an Emotional Face viewing experiment
B. Analyses of the reported experiences when eating amimo acids instead of breakfast (a tryptophan depletion
study)

1. Understanding the experiment
1.a.Comprehension question. Please explain which factor was between-participants and which were withinparticipants and why.
1.b. What was the age range of the participants?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, pastecs)

face_exp_2016<- read.csv("face_exp_data_all_160310.csv", sep=";")
face_exp_2017<- read.csv("face_exp_all_logs_2017.csv", sep=";")
#Binding the two datasets together
face_exp<-rbind(face_exp_2016,face_exp_2017)
#conditions are coded in the "cond_blue", "cond_emo" and "freq" variables

#1.a 
#the proportions of blue/yellow stimuli is the factor that was between-participants , i.e. the two groups. Each participant were exposed to both the predictor variable of amount of blue/yellow and amount of happy/neutral/fearful faces, making both conditions within-participant predictors. This means, that the blue/yellow factor, is both between and within.

#The proportions of blue/yellow stimuli can be considered between-participant factor. The participants in the two groups are therefore exposed to a different composition of stimuli, making it (the proportions of blue/yellow stimyli) a between participant factor.However, as the participants in each group also are exposed to the stimuli several times, making it a within participant design. Therefore the blue/yellow stimuli can also be considered a within-subject design. The amount of happy/neutral/fearful faces was equal for all groups, making it only a within-participant factor. 

#1.b 
#By investigating the dataset the age-range is from 19-27 years
```

2. Data exploring and preparation

Make sure that factorial variables are coded as factors using the as.factor() function.
2.a: make a box-plot of the data with RT on the y-axis and emotional condition on the x-axis. Make
a box-plot for each of the color conditions by using “fill”. Use facet_wrap() to make two seperate graphs for each frequency group. Give the boxes colors that mathces the stimuli, eg. use " +
scale_fill_manual(values=c(“yellow”,“blue”,“yellow”,“blue”,“yellow”,“blue”,“yellow”,“blue”))" .

```{r}
as.numeric(face_exp$rt)
as.factor(face_exp$cond_emo)
as.factor(face_exp$cond_blue)

ggplot(face_exp, aes(x = cond_emo, y = rt, fill = img)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~freq)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("yellow","blue","yellow","blue","yellow","blue","yellow","blue"))+
labs(x = "Condition Emotion", y = " Reaction Time")
```

2.b: Comprehension question. Explain why this plot shows that there is something wrong with the data.
outliers and wrong answers prolly

2.c.: Make a subset of the data, including only correct responses.

```{r}
as.factor(face_exp$correct_resp)
corresp_face_data <- subset(face_exp, correct_resp==1)
```


2.d.: Make another boxplot similar to that in 2.a. Did it solve the observed problem?

```{r}
ggplot(corresp_face_data, aes(x = cond_emo, y = rt, fill = img)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~freq)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("yellow","blue","yellow","blue","yellow","blue","yellow","blue"))+
labs(x = "Condition Emotion", y = " Reaction Time")
```

2.e.: Use the by() function and stat.desc (in library(pastecs)) to get descriptive measures for the different
conditions (e.g. see Field’s book chapter 5.5.3.2.). Try to investigate the three hypotheses based on the
descriptive statistics - would you expect any of the statistical analyses to be significant based on the descriptive
stats?

The experiment had the following behavioral hypotheses:
H1: The index finger (blue) trials will lead to a shorter response time than middle finger (yellow) trials.
H2: Fearful faces will yield a shorter response time than neutral.
H3: Infrequent stimuli will yield longer responses time than frequent. This should surface as an interaction
between color and frequency group.

```{r}
stat.desc(corresp_face_data$rt)
stat.desc(corresp_face_data$cond_emo, norm=TRUE)
stat.desc(corresp_face_data$cond_blue, norm = TRUE)
```

2.f.: Explore if the RT data is normally distributed using a qq-plot (e.g. qqnorm()).
```{r}
qqnorm(corresp_face_data$rt)

```


2.g.: log-transform the RT data.
```{r}
face_exp_trans <- corresp_face_data %>% mutate(rt_log = log(corresp_face_data$rt))
                                              
```


2.h.: Use a qq-plot to explore if the transformed data appear more normal than the untransformed.
```{r}
qqnorm(face_exp_trans$rt_log)
```


2.i.: Make a plot that explores the response times for participants, individually, using a box-plot. Does
anybody stick out as unusual?


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
